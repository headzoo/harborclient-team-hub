# Authentication

Service Hub protects API routes with database-backed bearer tokens tied to user accounts. HarborClient desktop clients authenticate with `user`-role tokens for shared data; operators authenticate with `admin`-role tokens for account management via the REST API (management endpoints are planned). The CLI remains available for user and token administration today.

## Prerequisites

Configure your database in `server.yaml`, then apply schema migrations:

```bash
service-hub migrate
```

For Postgres and MySQL this creates the `users` and `api_tokens` tables (plus entity tables). Firestore uses schemaless `users` and `apiTokens` collections.

Migration also assigns any legacy tokens without an owner to a bootstrap user named `bootstrap` with full (`*`) collection and environment access. Create named users, issue new tokens, then revoke bootstrap tokens when you are ready.

## Roles and access

Every account has a role of either `user` or `admin`. Set the role when creating or updating a user via the CLI (see [Manage users](#manage-users)).

### Roles

| Role | Purpose | Entity HTTP API | Management HTTP API | API tokens |
| ---- | ------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| `user` | HarborClient desktop clients | Scoped — [API Endpoints](./endpoints.md) | No (403) | Yes |
| `admin` | Operators and automation | **403 Forbidden** | User/token CRUD (planned) | Yes |

**`admin` accounts**

- Can receive bearer tokens for REST authentication.
- Cannot access collections, environments, folders, or requests (403 on entity routes).
- Do not use access lists (always stored empty); passing `--collection-access` or `--environment-access` on create or update is rejected.
- User and token management via REST is planned; the CLI remains available today.

**`user` accounts**

- Intended for HarborClient desktop clients authenticating with `hbk_…` bearer tokens.
- Permissions come from access lists described in [Access](#access) below.
- Cannot call management endpoints (403 when those routes exist).

### Access

Access lists scope what a `user`-role account can see and change on entity routes. Both fields are independent JSON arrays of UUID strings on the user record. Only `user`-role accounts use these fields; `admin` accounts always have `[]` and cannot access entity routes regardless.

**Wildcard `*`**

- `['*']` grants all resources of that type.
- The wildcard must be the only entry — the CLI rejects lists like `['*', '<uuid>']`.
- Set via `--collection-access '*'` or `--environment-access '*'`.

**What each list controls**

| Field | Governs |
| ----- | ------- |
| `collectionAccess` | Collections, and all folders and requests inside allowed collections |
| `environmentAccess` | Environments only |

**Permission matrix for `user` accounts**

| Access config | List (GET) | Create top-level resource (POST `/collections` or `/environments`) | CRUD inside allowed scope |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `['*']` | All | Yes | Yes |
| Specific UUIDs | Only listed ids | No (403) | Yes for listed collections/environments |
| `[]` | Empty (200, `[]`) | No | 403 on any entity operation |

Scoped users can create folders and requests **within** collections they can access. Only **new top-level** collections or environments require wildcard access on the relevant list.

**Token inheritance**

API tokens do not carry their own scope. Each token inherits the owning user's `collectionAccess` and `environmentAccess` entirely.

**HTTP outcomes**

- Invalid or missing token → **401** (see [API Endpoints — Errors](./endpoints.md#errors)).
- Valid token but wrong role or out-of-scope resource → **403** `{ "error": "Forbidden" }`.
- Too many failed auth attempts for the same client IP and token → **429** `{ "error": "Too Many Requests" }` with a `Retry-After` header.
- Throttle store unavailable → **503** `{ "error": "Service Unavailable" }`.

## Throttling

Failed authentication attempts are counted in Redis and throttled per **client IP + token**. Raw bearer secrets are never stored in Redis; the server hashes the token and uses `{ip}:{sha256(token)}` as the throttle key. Requests with no bearer token use `{ip}:none`.

**Default policy**

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| `maxFailures` | 10 | Failed attempts allowed within the window |
| `windowSeconds` | 900 (15 min) | Failure counter window |
| `blockSeconds` | 900 (15 min) | Block duration after threshold is reached |

When the block is active, protected routes return **429** with `Retry-After` set to the configured block duration. A successful authentication clears the failure counter and block for that key.

**Configuration**

Redis is required. Add a `redis` section to `server.yaml` and run Redis alongside the server (for local development, `docker compose up` starts Postgres and Redis):

```yaml
redis:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 6380
  # password: optional
  # keyPrefix: optional namespace for keys
  # maxFailures: 10
  # windowSeconds: 900
  # blockSeconds: 900
```

If Redis is unreachable while handling a protected request, authentication fails closed with **503** rather than allowing requests through without throttling.

## Manage users

Use the command line to create and manage users. See [CLI](./cli.md#user) for the full command reference, options, and output formats.

```bash
# Create an operator account (admin role, for management API tokens)
service-hub user create --name ops --role admin

# Create a user with full access
service-hub user create --name alice --role user \
  --collection-access '*' --environment-access '*'

# Create a user with access to specific collections/environments
service-hub user create --name bob --role user \
  --collection-access <collection-id> --environment-access <environment-id>

service-hub user list
service-hub user show <user-id>
service-hub user update <user-id> --role user --collection-access '*'
service-hub user delete <user-id>
```

## Manage tokens

Tokens always belong to a user. Issue `user`-role tokens for HarborClient desktop clients and `admin`-role tokens for operator REST clients. Entity routes require a `user`-role token; management routes will require an `admin`-role token. See [CLI — user token](./cli.md#user-token) for all token subcommands and flags.

```bash
service-hub user token create --user <user-id> --name "Alice laptop"
service-hub user token list
service-hub user token list --user <user-id>
service-hub user token revoke <token-id>
```

The `user token create` command prints a one-time secret prefixed with `hbk_`. Store it immediately — the server only persists a sha256 hash.

Example output:

```text
Created API token "Alice laptop" (550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000) for user "alice".
Token prefix: hbk_AbCd1234

Store this token now; it will not be shown again:
hbk_...
```
